### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from @FullstackAcademy in December 2022. Since then, I have utilized my software engineering skills to craft a website for a local musical artist. This website is currently in the pre-deployment stage. If you'd like to learn more about this project, I created a video which describes this project in more depth: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jacob-saddler_project-ecommerce-softwaredevelopment-activity-7030929945241559040-2Scm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop.
